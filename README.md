# recycler-view-sample

I created a sample app and kept it as simple as possible, so we can focus on RecyclerView only. 

The app downloads 1500 images from placehold.it so you can see how smooth the scrolling is. App downloads only 9 different images so you can also see how Picasso handles downloading and caching. If you aren’t familier with Picasso and don’t want to bother now, please don’t worry about it. All you need to know is it is for downloading images easily. Very, very easily!
